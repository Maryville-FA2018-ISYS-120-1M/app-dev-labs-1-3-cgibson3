 One feature you might want to give users is to display their current body temperature. Create a constant `tempInFahrenheit` equal to 98.6. 
 
 You may want to also show the temperature in celsius. You can convert fahrenheit to celsius by taking `tempInFahrenheit` and subtracting 32, then multiplying the result by (5.0/9.0). Create a constant `tempInCelsius` that calculates in one line the temperature in celsius.
