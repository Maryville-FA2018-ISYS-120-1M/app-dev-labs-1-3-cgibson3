let x: int

/*:
 Create a constant `multipliedAsDoubles` equal to `x` times `y`, but this time convert the `Int` to a `Double` in the expression. Print the result.
 */
let multipliedAsDoubles = x * y

/*:
 Are the values of `multipliedAsIntegers` and `multipliedAsDoubles` different? Print a statement to the console explaining why.
 */
print (yes, one is a decimal and the other is not)
